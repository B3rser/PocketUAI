#status: success, no_cookie, invalid_cookie, unknown, invalid_method, server_error, missing_fields, not_found, unauthorized
# Explanation of Response Statuses
#
# 1. success:
#    - Indicates that the operation was successful. The response includes a success message
#      and relevant data (e.g., user information or session details).
#    - Example use case: Successful user login, successful creation of a user, or a valid session.
#
# 2. no_cookie:
#    - This status is returned when no session cookie is found in the request. It typically means 
#      the user is not logged in or their session has expired.
#    - Example use case: The user makes a request that requires authentication, but no session cookie is present.
#
# 3. invalid_cookie:
#    - This status indicates that the session cookie provided is invalid or has expired. 
#      It prompts the user to log in again to obtain a valid session.
#    - Example use case: A request is made with a session cookie that cannot be verified or has been revoked.
#
# 4. unknown:
#    - This status is used when an unexpected error occurs during the processing of the request. 
#      It generally indicates a problem on the server-side that is not anticipated or handled by specific error cases.
#    - Example use case: A system error occurs that prevents the function from completing successfully, 
#      such as a database failure or a server crash.
#
# 5. invalid_method:
#    - This status indicates that the request method used is not valid for the specific API endpoint. 
#      For example, if a POST request is expected but a GET request is sent, this status will be returned.
#    - Example use case: A user attempts to access an endpoint using an incorrect HTTP method (e.g., GET instead of POST).
#
# 6. missing_fields:
#    - This status is returned when required fields are missing in the request body. 
#      The response provides a message indicating which fields are missing.
#    - Example use case: A user attempts to create a new user but fails to provide essential fields such as email or password.
#
# 7. not_found:
#    - This status indicates that the requested resource could not be found. It is commonly used in the case of 
#      invalid endpoints or non-existent user data.
#    - Example use case: A user attempts to access a resource (e.g., a user profile) that doesn't exist.
#
# 8. unauthorized:
#    - This status is returned when the user is not authorized to access the requested resource. 
#      It may occur when the userâ€™s session is invalid or they do not have the proper permissions.
#    - Example use case: A user attempts to access another user's data without the proper authorization.
#
# 9. server_error:
#    - This status indicates that an unexpected error occurred on the server side. 
#      It is typically used when something goes wrong during the request processing that doesn't fall under 
#      specific error statuses (e.g., database failures, system errors).
#    - Example use case: A general server issue or unhandled exception during the processing of a request.

def create_user(request):
    """
    Creates a new user by accepting a POST request with the user's data, such as name, email, password, income, and expenses. 
    The function creates a new user in Firebase Authentication and stores the user data in the Firestore database.

    The function checks that all required fields are provided (name, last name, email, and password) and returns an error response 
    if any are missing. If successful, it returns a success response with the user's unique ID and email. If any error occurs during 
    the user creation process, a server error response is returned with details of the exception.

    Parameters:
    request (HttpRequest): The HTTP request containing the user data in JSON format.
